# TrackTivity
Within both academic and business contexts, it is always of vital importance to maintain a high level of organization regarding events and tasks. It is no secret that, due to the many daily responsibilities, people often completely forget about events or tasks that were planned long ago. Therefore, an application capable of solving this issue would represent a significant improvement in both cases.
For this reason, TRACKTIVITY was created, an application designed to be the personal assistant or planner for anyone, from high school or university students to business professionals who need to remember or plan many things at once. Within this app, the user, after registering, has access to two calendars where they can create both events and tasks, as well as share their active calendars with other users. In the appâ€™s ecosystem, the user will find dynamic and easy-to-use interfaces, making them feel in a useful and productive space
